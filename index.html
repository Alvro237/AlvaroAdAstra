      <h1>Hello there! Welcome to another aerospace engineer's site</h1>
      <p>   This is my personal website dedicated to showcasing my work and projects in the aerospace field. It contains a bit about my background, and most of my interests. The real motivation behind this page is
        to keep track of my experience and share what I have learned through the years. Despite this being for my personal use, anyone is free to roam this page and use its tools.

      <section id="About">
      <h2>About me</h2>
      </p>  If you have reached this far, I should present myself. I just graduated from my bachelor in aerospace engineering, which means I am oficially an engineer. My college years have been the most complicated yet amusing years
      of my life. Each challenge brought the best of me and my classmates, and the lessons I learned will follow me throughout my carrer. You may be wondering where it may lead. Well, me too. However, I have always had an objective
      in mind, and the name of this page could give you a little hint. <strong>"Per aspera ad astra"</strong>, which translates to "Through hardships to the stars". Of course, this sentence is not mine, but I couldn't have expressed it better. Indeed, <strong>this journey started when I decided to become an astronaut</strong>, over 15 years ago. 
      Over time, I have met some brilliant minds, with similar interests and passions. I have discovered new branches of engineering, and my reasons to pursue this carrer have shifted. When I was young, I wanted to be in space,
      feel the zero gravity and see earth from a unique perspective. Later, I became aware that what pushes me further is the human desire to explore the unknown. Over the years, I have learned to crave a great challenge, and enjoy
      the feeling of completing it. Now, the will to contribute to enhancing humanity's knowledge and secure our place among the stars drives me forward.
      <p>
      <p>However, there is still much work to do, and my mission is far from being over. As you may have noticed, I am not an astronaut (yet, I hope). But my passion for engineering is still there, and thus I still push forward learning more
        about rocket propulsion, astrophysics, satellites, launches, space vehicles... and with this page, programming! Because no matter how incredible the destination may be, the aerospace journey still fascinates me day after day, and
        reminds me there are discoveries yet to be made in every single domain of science.

        <h3>Simulations Engineer @Madrid Space Europe</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Madrid Space is a consultant company for the Space Cluster. They solve thermal, structural and fluid problems, no matter how complex they are!</li>
          <li>I learned how to perform three types of simulations: 
          <ul>
            <li>CFD with Hypermesh CFD and OpenFOAM</li>
            <li>Thermal analyses with ESATAN</li>
            <li>Structural analyses with Hypermesh (FEM)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>It all started as an internship, but after 4 months I had a contract to work as a junior engineer!</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> I also defended my final year thesis and obtained 9.6/10! Nothing better than designing and simulating a rocket motor</p>
        <img src="images/Portada_TFG.png" alt="Portada" width="300" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Here is a quick snapshot of what the results looked like... </p>

        <h3>SAETA UC3M: Student's club</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>SAETA is a student group that builds UAVs</li>
          <li>I participated in the first XtraChallenge, hosted by the UPV with our flying wing design</li>
          <li>I also got started into CFD with Simscale and OpenFOAM</li>
          <li>We received founding from Aernnova, Airbus, Fuvex and many others. Thanks to all the members of the CR team!</li>
          <li>I designed the Motor integration part in CatiaV5 and 3D printed it</li>
          <li>I was a member of the Propulsion and Systems team, working our way through the power system, motors, propellers... We even worked on the landing gear!</li>
        </ul>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> This is the blended wing SAETA presented to the competition. Despite only being able to take of shortly, it set the path for the 2024 competition. The newer models fly (almost...) as smooth as an A320!! </p>
      <img src="images/Vencejo2.png" alt="Vencejo" width="300" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <p style="text-align: center;"> And here is the Motor integration piece assemby! Entirely printed in lightwheight PLA for the competition  </p>
