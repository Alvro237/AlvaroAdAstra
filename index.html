      <h1>Hello there! I'm Alvaro, an aerospace engineer.</h1>
      <p>   This is my personal website dedicated to showcasing my work and projects in the aerospace field. It contains a bit about my background, and most of my interests. The real motivation behind this page is
        to keep track of my experience and share what I have learned through the years. Despite this being for my personal use, anyone is free to roam this page and use its tools.

      <section id="About">
      <h2>About me</h2>
      </p>  If you have reached this far, I should present myself. I just graduated from my bachelor in aerospace engineering, which means I am oficially an engineer. My college years have been the most complicated yet amusing years
      of my life. Each challenge brought the best of me and my classmates, and the lessons I learned will follow me throughout my carrer. You may be wondering where it may lead. Well, me too. However, I have always had an objective
      in mind, and the name of this page could give you a little hint. <strong>"Per aspera ad astra"</strong>, which translates to "Through hardships to the stars". Indeed, <strong>this journey started when I decided to become an astronaut</strong>, over 15 years ago. 
      With the time, I have met some brilliant minds, with similar interests and passions. I have discovered new branches of engineering, and my reasons to pursue this carrer have shifted. When I was young, I wanted to be in space,
      feel the zero gravity and see earth from a unique perspective. Later, I became aware that what pushes me further is the human desire to explore the unknown. Over the years, I have learned to crave a great challenge, and enjoy
      the feeling of completing it. Now, the will to contribute to enhancing humanity's knowledge and secure our place among the stars drives me forward.
      <p>
      <p>However, there is still much work to do, and my mission is far from being over. As you may have noticed, I am not an astronaut (yet, I hope). But my passion for engineering is still there, and thus I still push forward learning more
        about rocket propulsion, astrophysics, satellites, launches, space vehicles... and with this page, programming! Because no matter how incredible the destination may be, the aerospace journey still fascinates me day after day, And
        reminds me there are discoveries yet to be made in every single domain of science.
