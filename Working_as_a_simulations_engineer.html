            <h2>What to expect as a simulations engineer?</h2>
            <p>During my time working in Madrid Space, I could rotate through the simulation departments: structural, thermal and CFD.
                 Since everything happened in only 11 months, I am still a beginner who has much to learn. However, that time is enough to 
                 obtain a global idea of how working in the simulations really is, and I want to share my experience in case someone is thinking
                 about following that path. </p>
        <p>
            For me, performing simulations of real objects was very appealing, even before I started. The possibilities that rise from being able to
            iterate a design, optimize it and predict its behavior without the need of manufacturing a prototype are highly valuable. in addition, I also
            took advantage of this experience to deepen my understanding of the physics behind many phenomena. Most of them where covered in the aerospace course,
            but for some I always felt I did not understand how the theory applied to real life. Either because the equations seemed too far, or too abstract.
            Whatever the reason, performing simulations and mostly seeing those colorful results really made me seem fullfilled. So, let us dive into it!

        </p>
        <p> First, I worked as a consultant, which means we did not have our own project, but rather a series of clients that come and go. Of course, this have its 
            pros and cons. The main advantage? Working in a variety of structures and being able to shift from one type of simulation to the other based on the client.
            There is more, of course. We could talk about how each project was different, which forced me to work on a fast-changing environment, a skill that is never
            useless. Of course, there are some drawbacks. The main one is that you can not choose the client personality, which means that sometimes you get stuck in aproject where
            you have very low room for desition making. So, before entering any company, you should think if that modes suits you or not. In my case, it was totally worth it, since
            learnig how to use three tools felt better than learning only about one.

            <h2>Structural engineering</h2>
            <p>This brach was the first one I dealt with and I must admit it has the most entretaining meshing process. Of course this means it has the one that takes the most. Despite
                CFD also needing a very refined and studied mesh, I found this one to be more user friendly, and less prone to make you go back in circles tunning parameters. I had the 
                opportunity to work with Hypermesh and optistruct, and I really enjoyed using this software. As I said before, meshing is the most time-consuming process, but also the less
                complex one once you have some practice.
                </p>
            <p> After meshing, the real engineering work begins. You need to organise your file: numbering the nodes, elements, assemblies, keeping track of the materials used... All of that 
                is part of the pre-processing. Of course, then you need to decide which modelling method is the best for the skrews in your system. And I know for a fact that screws are one of
                the most critical parts of the structuure, as breakage usutally starts close to them, if you recall your material courses.
                </p>
            <p>Once the model is ready, there is nothing else stopping you from running the simulations. Appart from the checks, which are crutial to ensure the model is realistic, there are many
                types of analysis you can perform. However, I will only talk about the ones I have seen: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Static:</strong> We solve equilibrium under steady loads assuming linear material behavior and small deformations</li>
                <li><strong>Modal (Normal Modes):</strong> We compute natural frequencies and mode shapes, since it is used for dynamic response understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Harmonic / Frequency Response (Sine):</strong>This is a steady-state sinusoidal excitation across frequency to get amplitude/phase response.</li>
                <li><strong>Transient Time-History:</strong> Time-domain dynamic simulation for arbitrary load histories (impulses, step loads...)</li>
                <li><strong>Random Vibration (PSD):</strong> Response to a brad spectrum of frequencies using power spectral density (PSD) apprach</li>
                <li><strong>Shock / Impulse:</strong>This is a short-duration high-amplitude loads analyzed in time.</li>
                <li><strong>Quasi-Static Load (QSL):</strong> Slowly-applied loads where inertial effects are negligible, often used to approximate gravity or other loads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Of course, there are many more, such as thermostructural, buckling, nonlinear, fatigue, contact, topology optimisation... But I haven't had the opportunity to test them yet!</p>

            <h2>Thermal engineering</h2>
            <p>Thermal engineering was the last branch I worked with. Because of this, I had less time to experiment with it, but it was still a profitable experience. I worked with ESATAN, and I 
                had the time to observe the peculiarities of these simulations. The main difference is the modelling level. Unline structural simulations, the mesh is much less refined, using larger 
                elements and even 2D shells to represent moderate-width objects. </p>
            <p> In this case, since the meshing process was simplified (up to some point), what really took the most time was accurately defining the linear conductors. Indeed, for people who have taken 
                somo thermodynamics classes, it is possible that this terms rings some bells. Basically, as it happens with electronics, the thermal paths can be represented using a thermal resistance, either in series
            or in parallel. By accuratelly modelling the most critical thermal paths of the model from the dissipating objects to the ambient, we can know the limit temperatures the system will reach.
           </p>
            <p> In addition, there is another peculiarity that becomes relevant: radiation. Indeed, every object at a certain temperatures shares heat with other objects. Specially in space, where there is no convection,
                there is no other way to evacuate heat. So, it is important to model the radiative interactions between each component and with the ambient. What I really liked about ESATAN is the fact that it automatically 
                computes the radiative exchange factors (REF) based on the exposed surface of an object and its optical propeties. In addition, it allows to model orbits and spacecraft trajectories to include earth's albedo,
                solar eclipses and other stellar phenomena. On earth, however, we also need to take into account convection, which is modelled using convective coefficients. These are not easy to estimate, and can require the
                use of CFD, empirical correlations, books... An engineer nevers stops investigating!
            </p>
            <p> Besides radiation and conductive GLs, we need to model internal dissipations, heaters, thermostats... All of this to ensure all the components temperature are within their operational limits. </p>

            <h2>Computer fluid dynamics</h2>
           <p>At last, but not least, I worked with CFD. By far, my favourite branch. This period in MSE allowed me to work in my bachelor thesis: Design and simulation of a micronozzle for in-space propulsion. I used many tools:
            NASA's CEA, coolprop, Matlab... but specially OpenFOAM. Working in CFD can vary a lot from one software to the other. Commercial software such as Ansys offer a very user-friendly interface, but of course are pretty expensive. Open source
            software, o the other hand have a much steeper learning curve but offer a much larger degree of customization. But, if you really want to work with CFD, the UI is the last of your concerns. Let's go trhough the most important characteristics.
            </p> 
            <p>
                First, it is important to have a solid understanding of fluid dynamics. Specially because in this discipline I have noticed the larger need to understand what is going one, intepret the results, peroform sanity chacks and understand what each
                variable is used for. After this, the real first step is the meshing, again. In this case, most softwares provide aun automatic mesher, but of course there is a catch. The problem is very sensitive to the mesh, so there are a series of steps you 
                need to follow to ensure mesh independency. I will list them now, but each of them is worth an independent study:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geometry simplification:</strong> Remove small features that do not affect the flow but complicate the mesh (small fillets, holes...)</li>
                <li><strong>Boundary layer refinement:</strong> To ensure the boundary layer is well represented and captures shear friction and turbulence phenmomena, a series of conditions must be met: the y+ must be accurately targeted. This means usually reaching
                a value of 1, but it depends on the turbulence model. Also, keeping a low growth factor (smaller than 1.3) and a consistent number of layers are key to having a good mesh. If you want to start with CFD, you need to research on these concepts a bit.</li>
                <li><strong>Perform a mesh sensitivity analisis:</strong>Try running the simulation with an increasing number of elements (finner mesh). The moment the solution starts to converge is the moment the mesh no longer influence the solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesh quality checks:</strong> Evaluate skewness, aspect ratio, orthogonality to ensure numerical stability and accuracy, usually using build-in tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Having a good mesh is only the tip of the iceberg. You will need to choose the solver, the turbulence model, the equations you will need to use, the discretization shceme, the boundary conditions and the initial conditions. Appart from the last two, there are many
                ressources online to help you make these choices. It could be a paper about a simialr problem, a publication about tips and tricks of your solver, common values... For the last two, it is up to your understanding of the physics behind to select a appropiate boundary condition.
                Here are some tips I learned during my time: If you are expecting supersonic flow, do not impose boundary conditions at the exit, but rather let the flow extrapolate from the interior. (This has t do with the characteristic mach lines, if you want to research it). Also, a symmetry
                boundary condition well applied could be the difference between simulating for one weekend or one week. Finally if the results are unphysical, most of the time the mesh is responsible.
            </p>

        </section>  
                    <p> I could talk for hours about the marvels of CFD, or simulation in general, but what I want to convey is the amazing range of possibilities that exist in the simualtions domain. Even more if you consider that you could couple some of them, to get thermostructural analyses, or heat transfer 
                problems with convection. The possibilities are endless, and I encourage you to explore them! Again, I am no expert, I talk from my short experience and everything is subjective. However, I hope I have help you understand what this branch of engineering really looks like.I hope this quick article helps you find your passion, as I found mine.</p>
