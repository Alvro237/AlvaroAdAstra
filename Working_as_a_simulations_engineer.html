            <h2>What to expect as a simulations engineer?</h2>
            <p>During my time working in Madrid Space, I was able to rotate through the simulation departments: structural, thermal, and CFD.
              Since everything happened in just 11 months, I am still a beginner who has much to learn. However, that time was enough to 
              obtain a global idea of what working in simulations is really like, and I want to share my experience in case someone is
              thinking about following this path. </p>
        <p>
            For me, performing simulations of real objects was very appealing, even before I started. The possibilities that arise from being able to
            iterate a design, optimize it, and predict its behavior without the need of manufacturing a prototype are highly valuable. In addition, I also
            took advantage of this experience to deepen my understanding of the physics behind many phenomena. Most of them were covered in the aerospace course,
            but for some, I always felt I did not understand how the theory applied to real life. Either because the equations seemed too far removed, or too abstract.
            Whatever the reason, performing simulations and, most of all, seeing those colorful results really made me feel fulfilled. So, let us dive into it!

        </p>
        <p> I worked on a variety of projects, each with its own technical challenges and priorities. This gave me the opportunity to explore three different simulation branches, allowing me to gain valuable experience and become familiar with a range of tools and methodologies. I would like to share some reflections for those considering a similar path.
            Switching between projects taught me to adapt quickly, manage evolving requirements, and remain efficient in fast-paced environments. One of the main benefits of this approach was the chance to broaden my skill set rather than specialize too narrowly from the start. It was an intense learning experience that provided a solid foundation across different areas of the field.
            In the following sections, I will go deeper into each of these areas.

            <h2>Structural engineering</h2>
            <p>This branch was the first one I dealt with, and I must admit it has the most entertaining meshing process. This also means it is the most time-consuming. Despite
              CFD also needing a very refined and studied mesh, I found this one to be more user-friendly and less prone to making you go back in circles while tuning parameters. I had the 
              opportunity to work with Hypermesh and OptiStruct, and I really enjoyed using this software. As I said before, meshing is the most time-consuming process but also the least
              complex one once you have some practice.
              </p>
            <p> After meshing, the real engineering work begins. You need to organize your file: numbering the nodes, elements, assemblies, and keeping track of the materials used... All of that 
              is part of the pre-processing. Of course, then you need to decide which modeling method is the best for the screws in your system. And I know for a fact that screws are one of
              the most critical parts of the structure, as breakage usually starts close to them, if you recall your material courses.
              </p>
            <p>Once the model is ready, there is nothing else stopping you from running the simulations. Apart from the crucial checks to ensure the model is realistic, there are many
              types of analysis you can perform. However, I will only talk about the ones I have seen: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Linear Static:</strong> We solve for equilibrium under steady loads, assuming linear material behavior and small deformations.</li>
              <li><strong>Modal (Normal Modes):</strong> We compute natural frequencies and mode shapes, as it is used for dynamic response understanding. It is always important to do this to avoid resonance!</li>
              <li><strong>Harmonic / Frequency Response (Sine):</strong> Analyzes steady-state sinusoidal excitation across frequencies to get amplitude/phase response. BBasically this means we seek to understand how a structure reacts to a rhythmic force such as an engine vibration.</li>
              <li><strong>Transient Time-History:</strong> Time-domain dynamic simulation for arbitrary load histories (impulses, step loads...)</li>
              <li><strong>Random Vibration (PSD):</strong> Response to a broad spectrum of frequencies using a power spectral density (PSD) approach. As it name suggest, we model chaotic vibrations, such as a rocket launch.</li>
              <li><strong>Shock / Impulse:</strong> Analyzes short-duration high-amplitude loads in time.</li>
              <li><strong>Quasi-Static Load (QSL):</strong> Slowly-applied loads where inertial effects are negligible, often used to approximate gravity or other loads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Of course, there are many more, such as thermostructural, buckling, nonlinear, fatigue, contact, topology optimization... But I haven't had the opportunity to test them yet!</p>

            <h2>Thermal engineering</h2>
            <p>Thermal engineering was the last branch I worked with. Because of this, I had less time to experiment with it, but it was still a valuable experience. I worked with ESATAN, and I 
              had the time to observe the peculiarities of these simulations. The main difference is the modeling level. Unlike structural simulations, the mesh is much less refined, using larger 
              elements and even 2D shells to represent moderate-width objects. </p>
            <p> In this case, since the meshing process was simplified (up to a point), what really took the most time was accurately defining the linear conductors. Indeed, for people who have taken 
              some thermodynamics classes, it is possible that this term rings a bell. Basically, similar to electronics, the thermal paths can be represented using a thermal resistance, either in series
            or in parallel. By accurately modeling the most critical thermal paths of the model from the dissipating objects to the surroundings, we can determine the limit temperatures the system will reach.
           </p>
            <p> In addition, there is another peculiarity that becomes relevant: radiation. Indeed, every object at a certain temperature transfers heat with other objects. Especially in space, where there is no convection,
              there is no other way to evacuate heat. So, it is important to model the radiative interactions between each component and with the ambient. What I really liked about ESATAN is the fact that it automatically 
              computes the radiative exchange factors (REF) based on the exposed surface of an object and its optical properties. In addition, it allows you to model orbits and spacecraft trajectories to include Earth's albedo,
              solar eclipses, and other stellar phenomena. On Earth, however, we also need to take into account convection, which is modeled using convective coefficients. These are not easy to estimate and can require the
              use of CFD, empirical correlations, books... An engineer never stops investigating!
            </p>
            <p> Besides radiation and conductive GLs, we need to model internal dissipations, heaters, thermostats... All of this to ensure the temperature of all components is within their operational limits. </p>

            <h2>Computer fluid dynamics</h2>
            <p>At last, but not least, I worked with CFD. By far, my favorite branch. This period in MSE allowed me to work on my bachelor's thesis: Design and simulation of a micronozzle for in-space propulsion. I used many tools:
              NASA's CEA, CoolProp, MATLAB... but especially OpenFOAM. Working in CFD can vary a lot from one software to another. Commercial software such as Ansys offers a very user-friendly interface, but of course it is quite expensive. Open-source
              software, on the other hand, has a much steeper learning curve but offers a much larger degree of customization. But, if you really want to work with CFD, the UI is the last of your concerns. Let's go through the most important characteristics.
            </p> 
            <p>
                First, it is important to have a solid understanding of fluid dynamics. Especially because in this discipline I have noticed the greatest need to understand what is going on, interpret the results, perform sanity checks, and understand what each
              variable is used for. After this, the real first step is the meshing process. In this case, most software provides an automatic mesher, but of course there is a catch. The problem is very sensitive to the mesh, so there are a series of steps you 
              need to follow to ensure mesh independence. I will list them now, but each of them is worth an independent study:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Geometry simplification:</strong> Remove small features that do not affect the flow but complicate the mesh (small fillets, holes...)</li>
              <li><strong>Boundary layer refinement:</strong> To ensure the boundary layer is well-represented and captures shear friction and turbulence phenomena, a series of conditions must be met: the y+ must be accurately targeted. This means usually reaching
              a value of 1, but it depends on the turbulence model. Also, keeping a low growth factor (smaller than 1.3) and a consistent number of layers are key to having a good mesh. If you want to start with CFD, you need to research these concepts a bit.</li>
              <li><strong>Perform a mesh sensitivity analysis:</strong> Try running the simulation with an increasing number of elements (finer mesh). The moment the solution starts to converge is the moment the mesh no longer influences the solution.</li>
              <li><strong>Mesh quality checks:</strong> Evaluate skewness, aspect ratio, orthogonality to ensure numerical stability and accuracy, usually using built-in tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Having a good mesh is only the tip of the iceberg. You will need to choose the solver, the turbulence model, the equations you will need to use, the discretization scheme, the boundary conditions, and the initial conditions. Apart from the last two, there are many
              resources online to help you make these choices. It could be a paper about a similar problem, a publication about tips and tricks of your solver, common values... For the last two, it is up to your understanding of the physics behind them to select an appropriate boundary condition.
              Here are some tips I learned during my time: If you are expecting supersonic flow, do not impose boundary conditions at the exit, but rather let the flow extrapolate from the interior. (This has to do with the characteristic Mach lines, if you want to research it). Also, a symmetry
              boundary condition well applied could be the difference between simulating for one weekend or one week. Finally, if the results are unphysical, most of the time the mesh is responsible.
            </p>
            <p> What is interesting in CFD is the wide range of applications and outcomes it has. We could model an airfoil, a rocket, a buiding, a pipe, a turbomachine... And we can obtain virtually anything fuild-related: velocity, pressure, temperature, eddy viscosity, drag, lift, shear force, heat transfer... 
                It is all of this variability that makes CFD a never ending cycle of learning. This also means this discipline never gets boring! Although I could say the same about the other two...
            </p>

        </section> 
        <p> I could talk for hours about the marvels of CFD, or simulation in general, but what I want to convey is the amazing range of possibilities that exist in the simulations domain. This is even more true when you consider that you could couple some of them, to get thermostructural analyses, or heat transfer 
            problems with convection. The possibilities are endless, and I encourage you to explore them! Again, I am no expert, I speak from my short experience, and everything is subjective. However, I hope I have helped you understand what this branch of engineering really looks like. I hope this quick article helps you find your passion, as I found mine.</p>
